## Overview

The "Patient Intake and Output Tracking System" is an application for healthcare professionals to keep track of patients' intake and output. With this system, nurses can record the amount and type of substances consumed or expelled by a patient. The data can then be viewed and analyzed by doctors for diagnosis and treatment purposes.

2. **Data Display**: View records of patient intake/output in a table format. Each entry can be removed if necessary.
3. **Total Intake/Output Calculation**: Automatically calculate the total amount of substances consumed/expelled by a patient.
4. **One-click Download**: Download the data as a PDF file with a single click, enabling easy sharing and storage.
5. **Data Visualization**: View intake/output data in bar chart format for a clearer and more intuitive understanding.

2. **Data Display Table**: On the right side, the entered data is displayed in a tabular format. There's an option to delete records if needed.
3. **Download Button**: At the bottom, there's a button for downloading the displayed data as a PDF file.
4. **Bar Charts**: At the bottom, bar charts show a comparison between total intake and output amounts.
